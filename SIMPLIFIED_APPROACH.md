# Simplified Document Processing Approach

## Overview

The Document Guy application has been simplified to focus on direct text extraction without relying on OpenAI's file upload API. This approach is more straightforward and efficient for our use case.

## How It Works Now

1. **File Upload**:
   - When a user uploads a PDF or text file, it's sent to our FastAPI backend.
   - The backend extracts text content directly using PyPDF2 for PDFs or simple file reading for text files.
   - The extracted text and metadata (like page count) are returned to the frontend.

2. **Chat Interface**:
   - The extracted document text is included directly in the prompt to the AI model.
   - When a user asks a question, the document content is sent as context in the system message.
   - This allows the AI to reference the document content without needing separate file upload APIs.

3. **Benefits**:
   - Simpler implementation with fewer API calls
   - More direct control over what content is sent to the model
   - No need to manage file uploads on OpenAI's servers
   - Works with any model, not just those with specific file handling capabilities

## Technical Implementation

- Backend: FastAPI handles file uploads, extracts text, and processes chat requests
- Frontend: Next.js provides the UI and forwards requests to the backend
- Document Processing: PyPDF2 extracts text from PDFs directly on our server

This approach focuses on the core functionality needed - getting document content to the AI model in a format it can use to answer questions.

## Future Enhancements

For handling larger documents beyond the context window limits, see the advanced chunking strategy described in [docs/chunking_strategy.md](docs/chunking_strategy.md), which explains:
- How to split documents into meaningful chunks
- Using embeddings to find the most relevant sections
- Dynamically including only the relevant context for each query
